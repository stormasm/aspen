react, redux and d3 functionality implemented using
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

This is a fork of [react-redux-d3](https://github.com/lucmerceron/React-Redux-D3).

* No longer serving up the static bundle via Express which is faster
on startup assuming the webpack bundle is already built.
* All of the npm packages have been upgraded to the latest versions
* Vastly simplified and deleted un-used files mainly in the area of routing

* **nice implementation** of
[Pure.css](https://purecss.io/) menus
